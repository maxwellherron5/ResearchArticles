# ResearchArticles
Research articles I have contributed to with the collaboration of fellow student undergrads at Augsburg University
This contains the research paper on the development of a Reinforcement Learning agent to play Starcraft II, which was 
submitted to the MICS convention. It also contains a paper detailing the creation of a Beowoulf Cluster, which was
a collaborative group project funded via Urgo and presented at Augsburg University.
